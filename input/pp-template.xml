    <section title="Overview" id="ppoverview">


The scope of this Protection Profile (PP) is to
      describe the security functionality of QQQQ products in terms of <cite linkend="bibCC"/>
      and to define functional and assurance requirements for such products.
      An operating system is software that manages computer hardware and software
      resources, and provides common services for application programs. The hardware
      it manages may be physical or virtual.

      <h:p> This is going to show some tests:
 	<h:ul>
	  <h:li> Terms with abbrs like ASLR, or API, should be found a linked automatically.</h:li>
          <h:li> And components can be refered to by their name: FQQ_QQQ.1 </h:li>
          <h:li> And so can requirements: FQQ_QQQ.1.1 or by their unique identifier: <linkref linkend="a-unique-id"/></h:li>
 
   	  <h:li> Or you can stop them <no-link>ASLR</no-link> </h:li>
          <h:li> This is how you do a picture: 
                <figure entity="images/niaplogo.png" title="Niap's Logo " id="fig-logo"/> </h:li>
          <h:li> And this is how you reference it: <figref refid="fig-logo"/></h:li>
          <h:li> This is how you do an equation with an arbitrary counter:  
              <equation><value>x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}</value>
                        <label><ctr id="quadeq" ctr-type='eq-'/></label></equation>

</h:li> 
          <h:li> And this is how you reference it: <ctr-ref refid="quadeq"/> </h:li>
          <h:li> <h:div><depends on="selection"><uid>aaa</uid></depends> 
                    Some text </h:div> </h:li>

                    Someting dependent on a feature</h:div> </h:li> 

          <h:li> And here's the audit event table for mandatory requirements. <h:br/>

      <term abbr='API' full="Application Programming Interface"/>
      <term full="Address Space Layout Randomization" abbr="ASLR">
	An anti-exploitation feature which loads memory mappings into unpredictable
	locations. ASLR makes it more difficult for an attacker to redirect control to code
	that they have introduced into the address space of a process.
      </term>
      <term full="Administrator">
	An administrator is responsible for management activities, including setting policies that are 
	applied by the enterprise on the operating system.
	This administrator could be acting remotely through a management server, from which the system
	receives configuration policies.
	An administrator can enforce settings on the system which cannot be overridden by non-administrator users.
      </term>
      <term full="Application" abbr="app">
	Software that runs on a platform and performs tasks on behalf of the user
	or owner of the platform, as well as its supporting documentation. 
      </term>
      <term full="Application Programming Interface" abbr="API">
	A specification of routines, data structures, object classes, and variables
	that allows an application to make use of services provided by another software
	component, such as a library. APIs are often provided for a set of libraries included
	with the platform.

      <term full="Critical Security Parameters" abbr="CSP">
	Information that is either user or system defined and
	is used to operate a cryptographic module in processing encryption functions including
	cryptographic keys and authentication data, such as passwords, the disclosure or modification
	of which can compromise the security of a cryptographic module or the security of the
	information protected by the module.
      </term>
      <term full="Data At Rest" abbr="DAR" />
      <term full="DAR Protection">
	Countermeasures that prevent attackers, even those with physical access,
	from extracting data from non-volatile storage.
	Common techniques include data encryption and wiping.
      </term>
      <term full="Data Execution Prevention" abbr="DEP">
	An anti-exploitation feature of modern operating systems executing on
	modern computer hardware, which enforces a non-execute permission on pages of memory.
	DEP prevents pages of memory from containing both data and instructions, which makes
	it more difficult for an attacker to introduce and execute code.
      </term>
      <term abbr='DES' full="Data Encryption Standard"/>
      <term full="Developer">
	An entity that writes OS software. For the purposes of this document,
	vendors and developers are the same.
      </term>
      <term full="General Purpose Operating System">
	A class of OSes designed to support a wide-variety of workloads consisting of many concurrent applications or services.
	Typical characteristics for OSes in this class include support for third-party applications,
	support for multiple users, and security separation between users and their respective resources.
	General Purpose Operating Systems also lack the real-time constraint that defines Real Time Operating Systems (RTOS).
	RTOSes typically power routers, switches, and embedded devices.

Generally, this is only once at <abbr linkend="VM"/> startup. However, some devices can be connected and disconnected during operation (e.g., virtual USB devices such as CD-ROMs). All such connection/disconnection events must be logged.

    <section title="Security Assurance Requirements" id="SARs">
      The Security Objectives in 
      <secref linkend="obj"/> were constructed to address threats identified in
      <secref linkend="threats"/>. The Security Functional Requirements (<abbr linkend="SFR"/>s)
      in <secref linkend="SFRs"/> are a formal instantiation of the Security Objectives. The PP
      identifies the Security Assurance Requirements (<abbr linkend="SAR"/>s) to frame the extent to
      which the evaluator assesses the documentation applicable for the evaluation and performs
      independent testing. <h:br/> This section lists the set of <abbr linkend="SAR"/>s from CC part 3
      that are required in evaluations against this PP. Individual Assurance Activities
      <!--(AAs). Never use these again --> to be performed are specified both in <secref
        linkend="req"/> as well as in this section. <h:br/> The general model for evaluation of <abbr
        linkend="OS"/>s against STs written to conform to this PP is as follows: <h:br/> After the
        <abbr linkend="ST"/> has been approved for evaluation, the <abbr class="expanded"
        title="Information Technology Security Evaluation Facility">ITSEF</abbr> will obtain the
        <abbr linkend="OS"/>, supporting environmental IT, and the administrative/user guides for
      the OS. The ITSEF is expected to perform actions mandated by the Common Evaluation
      Methodology (CEM) for the ASE and ALC SARs. The ITSEF also performs the Assurance Activities
      contained within <secref linkend="req"/>, which are intended to be an interpretation of the
      other CEM assurance requirements as they apply to the specific technology instantiated in the
      OS. The Assurance Activities that are captured in <secref linkend="req"/> also provide
      clarification as to what the developer needs to provide to demonstrate the OS is compliant
      with the PP. <subsection title="Class ASE: Security Target" id="ase">As per ASE activities
        defined in <cite linkend="bibCEM"/>.</subsection>
      <subsection title="Class ADV: Development" id="adv">The information about the <abbr
          linkend="OS"/> is contained in the guidance documentation available to the end user as
        well as the <abbr linkend="TSS"/> portion of the <abbr linkend="ST"/>. The <abbr
          linkend="OS"/> developer must concur with the description of the product that is
        contained in the TSS as it relates to the functional requirements. The Assurance Activities
        contained in <secref linkend="SFRs"/> should provide the <abbr linkend="ST"/> authors with
        sufficient information to determine the appropriate content for the TSS section.

          functional specification describes the <abbr title="TSF Interface">TSFI</abbr>s. It is not
          necessary to have a formal or complete specification of these interfaces. Additionally,
          because <abbr linkend="OS"/>s conforming to this PP will necessarily have interfaces to
          the Operational Environment that are not directly invokable by <abbr linkend="OS"/>
          users, there is little point specifying that such interfaces be described in and of
          themselves since only indirect testing of such interfaces may be possible. For this PP,
          the activities for this family should focus on understanding the interfaces presented in
          the <abbr linkend="TSS"/> in response to the functional requirements and the interfaces
          presented in the AGD documentation. No additional “functional specification” documentation
          is necessary to satisfy the assurance activities specified. The interfaces that need to be
          evaluated are characterized through the information needed to perform the assurance
          activities listed, rather than as an independent, abstract list.

        The former is done through the ATE_IND family, while the latter is through the AVA_VAN
        family. At the assurance level specified in this PP, testing is based on advertised
        functionality and interfaces with dependency on the availability of design information. One
        of the primary outputs of the evaluation process is the test report as specified in the

              not necessary to have one test case per test listed in an Assurance Activity, the
              evaluator must document in the test plan that each applicable testing requirement in
              the <abbr linkend="ST"/> is covered. The test plan identifies the platforms to be
              tested, and for those platforms not included in the test plan but included in the
                <abbr linkend="ST"/>, the test plan provides a justification for not testing the
              platforms. This justification must address the differences between the tested
              platforms and the untested platforms, and make an argument that the differences do not
              affect the testing to be performed. It is not sufficient to merely assert that the
              differences have no affect; rationale must be provided. If all platforms claimed in
              the <abbr linkend="ST"/> are tested, then no rationale is necessary. The test plan
              describes the composition of each platform to be tested, and any setup that is
              necessary beyond what is contained in the AGD documentation. It should be noted that
              the evaluator is expected to follow the AGD documentation for installation and setup
              of each platform either as part of a test or as a standard pre-test condition. This
              may include special test drivers or tools. For each driver or tool, an argument (not
              just an assertion) should be provided that the driver or tool will not adversely
              affect the performance of the functionality by the <abbr linkend="OS"/> and its
              platform. <h:br/> This also includes the configuration of the cryptographic engine to be
              used. The cryptographic algorithms implemented by this engine are those specified by
              this PP and used by the cryptographic protocols being evaluated (IPsec, TLS). The test
              plan identifies high-level test objectives as well as the test procedures to be
              followed to achieve those objectives. These procedures include expected results. <h:br/>
              The test report (which could just be an annotated version of the test plan) details
              the activities that took place when the test procedures were executed, and includes
              the actual results of the tests. This shall be a cumulative account, so if there was a
              test run that resulted in a failure; a fix installed; and then a successful re-run of
              the test, the report would show a “fail” and “pass” result (and the supporting
              details), and not just the “pass” result.</aactivity>

  <appendix title="Entropy Documentation and Assessment" id="entropyappendix"> This appendix
    describes the required supplementary information for the entropy source used by the OS. <h:br/>
    The documentation of the entropy source should be detailed enough that, after reading, the
    evaluator will thoroughly understand the entropy source and why it can be relied upon to provide
    sufficient entropy. This documentation should include multiple detailed sections: design
    description, entropy justification, operating conditions, and health testing. This documentation
    is not required to be part of the TSS. <section id="entropydesign" title="Design Description">
      Documentation shall include the design of the entropy source as a whole, including the
      interaction of all entropy source components. Any information that can be shared regarding the
      design should also be included for any third-party entropy sources that are included in the
      product. <h:br/> The documentation will describe the operation of the entropy source to include,
      how entropy is produced, and how unprocessed (raw) data can be obtained from within the
      entropy source for testing purposes. The documentation should walk through the entropy source
      design indicating where the entropy comes from, where the entropy output is passed next, any
      post-processing of the raw outputs (hash, XOR, etc.), if/where it is stored, and finally, how
      it is output from the entropy source. Any conditions placed on the process (e.g., blocking)
      should also be described in the entropy source design. Diagrams and examples are encouraged.
      <h:br/> This design must also include a description of the content of the security boundary of
      the entropy source and a description of how the security boundary ensures that an adversary
      outside the boundary cannot affect the entropy rate. <h:br/> If implemented, the design
      description shall include a description of how third-party applications can add entropy to the
      RBG. A description of any RBG state saving between power-off and power-on shall be included. </section>
    <section id="entropyjustification" title="Entropy Justification"> There should be a technical
      argument for where the unpredictability in the source comes from and why there is confidence
      in the entropy source delivering sufficient entropy for the uses made of the RBG output (by
      this particular OS). This argument will include a description of the expected min-entropy
      rate (i.e. the minimum entropy (in bits) per bit or byte of source data) and explain that
      sufficient entropy is going into the OS randomizer seeding process. This discussion will be
      part of a justification for why the entropy source can be relied upon to produce bits with
      entropy. <h:br/> The amount of information necessary to justify the expected min-entropy rate
      depends on the type of entropy source included in the product. <h:br/> For developer provided
      entropy sources, in order to justify the min-entropy rate, it is expected that a large number
      of raw source bits will be collected, statistical tests will be performed, and the min-entropy
      rate determined from the statistical tests. While no particular statistical tests are required
      at this time, it is expected that some testing is necessary in order to determine the amount
      of min-entropy in each output. <h:br/> For third-party provided entropy sources, in which the
      OS vendor has limited access to the design and raw entropy data of the source, the
      documentation will indicate an estimate of the amount of min-entropy obtained from this
      third-party source. It is acceptable for the vendor to “assume” an amount of min-entropy,
      however, this assumption must be clearly stated in the documentation provided. In particular,
      the min-entropy estimate must be specified and the assumption included in the ST. <h:br/>
      Regardless of type of entropy source, the justification will also include how the DRBG is
      initialized with the entropy stated in the ST, for example by verifying that the min-entropy
      rate is multiplied by the amount of source data used to seed the DRBG or that the rate of
      entropy expected based on the amount of source data is explicitly stated and compared to the
      statistical rate. If the amount of source data used to seed the DRBG is not clear or the
      calculated rate is not explicitly related to the seed, the documentation will not be
      considered complete. <h:br/> The entropy justification shall not include any data added from any
      third-party application or from any state saving between restarts. </section>
    <section id="entropyoperatingconditions" title="Operating Conditions"> The entropy rate may be
      affected by conditions outside the control of the entropy source itself. For example, voltage,
      frequency, temperature, and elapsed time after power-on are just a few of the factors that may
      affect the operation of the entropy source. As such, documentation will also include the range
      of operating conditions under which the entropy source is expected to generate random data. It
      will clearly describe the measures that have been taken in the system design to ensure the
      entropy source continues to operate under those conditions. Similarly, documentation shall
      describe the conditions under which the entropy source is known to malfunction or become
      inconsistent. Methods used to detect failure or degradation of the source shall be included. </section>
    <section id="entropyhealthtesting" title="Health Testing"> More specifically, all entropy source
      health tests and their rationale will be documented. This includes a description of the health
      tests, the rate and conditions under which each health test is performed (e.g., at start,
      continuously, or on-demand), the expected results for each health test, and rationale
      indicating why each test is believed to be appropriate for detecting one or more failures in
      the entropy source. </section>
